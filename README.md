# Final

Classic Snake game, but replace the snake with a goblin  and the fruit with a coin (just like clash of clans).

Once you run the main file, click on the play button to play using your arrow keys. The goal is to gather as many coins as possible and lengthen the goblin chain. You cannot hit the wall or another goblin because you will lose!!! 

After you lose click on the textbox to enter your username to record your score. The leaderboard consists of the top 5 scores, so you have to perform very well!

Enjoy!!!
